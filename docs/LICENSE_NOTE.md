# License Information

## Current License: PROPRIETARY - Source Available for Review Only

This repository is now licensed under a **Proprietary License**, which is a **restrictive source-available license**.

**Decision Made**: The repository owner has chosen the most restrictive license option to enforce "review only" access.

### What the Proprietary License Restricts

The Proprietary License permits:
- ✅ View and read the source code
- ✅ Study the code for educational purposes
- ✅ Review the code for security assessment
- ✅ Reference the code in academic contexts with attribution

The Proprietary License **PROHIBITS**:
- ❌ Using the software for any purpose
- ❌ Copying or reproducing the code
- ❌ Modifying or creating derivative works
- ❌ Distributing or sharing the software
- ❌ Commercial use of any kind
- ❌ Deploying the software in any environment

## ✅ Decision Implemented

**Repository Owner's Intent**: The repository is made public for **review and reference purposes only**.

The **Proprietary License now in effect prevents copying and usage**, aligning with the owner's intent.

## Alternative License Options

If the repository owner wishes to **restrict usage** while still allowing public viewing, consider these alternative licenses:

### 1. **Source Available License (Recommended for "Check Only" Intent)**
Create a custom license that:
- Allows viewing and reading the code
- Allows non-commercial personal use
- Prohibits commercial use without permission
- Prohibits redistribution

**Example**: Elastic License 2.0, Business Source License (BSL)

### 2. **Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**
- ✅ Attribution required
- ✅ Non-commercial use only
- ❌ No derivatives (modifications)
- ❌ No commercial use

### 3. **Proprietary License with Public Source**
- Keep the source code public but add a custom license header
- Explicitly state usage restrictions
- Require written permission for commercial use

### 4. **Apache License 2.0**
Similar to MIT but:
- Provides better patent protection
- Requires changes to be documented
- More explicit about trademark use

## Recommendation

### If "Check Only" Is the Goal:
1. **Remove or Replace the MIT License** with a custom restrictive license
2. Add a clear LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file with:
   ```
   Proprietary License - Source Available for Review

   Copyright (c) 2025 [Repository Owner]

   This software and associated documentation files (the "Software") are 
   made available for review and reference purposes only.

   Permission is NOT granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, 
   distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without 
   explicit written permission from the copyright holder.

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
   ```

3. Add a prominent notice in README.md:
   ```markdown
   ## License Notice

   This repository is source-available for review purposes only. 
   Commercial use, copying, and distribution are prohibited without 
   explicit written permission from the repository owner.
   ```

### If Open Source Is the Goal:
Keep the current MIT License, which allows anyone to use, copy, and modify the code freely.

## ✅ Decision Made

**The repository owner has selected Option B**: Proprietary restrictive license.

This decision means:
- ✅ Code is viewable for review purposes
- ❌ No copying, usage, or distribution allowed
- ❌ No commercial use permitted
- ✅ All rights reserved by copyright holder

**Note**: This license applies to all current and future versions. Previous versions released under MIT License (if any) remain under that license for those who obtained them before this change.

## Implementation Completed

The license has been changed:

1. ✅ Replaced LICENSE file with proprietary license
2. ✅ Updated README.md to reflect new license
3. ✅ Added prominent license notices in documentation
4. ✅ Updated QUICK_START.md with license information
5. ✅ Updated badge from MIT to Proprietary

---

**Summary**: The current MIT License allows anyone to copy and use this solution freely. If the intent is "check only", the license needs to be changed to a more restrictive one.
