# License Information

## Current License: MIT

This repository is currently licensed under the **MIT License**, which is a **permissive open-source license**.

### What the MIT License Allows

The MIT License permits anyone to:
- ✅ View and read the source code
- ✅ Copy and modify the code
- ✅ Use the software commercially
- ✅ Distribute the software
- ✅ Sublicense the software
- ✅ Use the software privately

The only requirement is that the license and copyright notice must be included in all copies.

## ⚠️ Important Note from Repository Owner

**Repository Owner's Intent**: The repository is made public primarily for **review and reference purposes**, not for unrestricted copying and commercial use.

However, the **MIT License currently in effect allows full commercial use and copying**.

## Alternative License Options

If the repository owner wishes to **restrict usage** while still allowing public viewing, consider these alternative licenses:

### 1. **Source Available License (Recommended for "Check Only" Intent)**
Create a custom license that:
- Allows viewing and reading the code
- Allows non-commercial personal use
- Prohibits commercial use without permission
- Prohibits redistribution

**Example**: Elastic License 2.0, Business Source License (BSL)

### 2. **Creative Commons CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**
- ✅ Attribution required
- ✅ Non-commercial use only
- ❌ No derivatives (modifications)
- ❌ No commercial use

### 3. **Proprietary License with Public Source**
- Keep the source code public but add a custom license header
- Explicitly state usage restrictions
- Require written permission for commercial use

### 4. **Apache License 2.0**
Similar to MIT but:
- Provides better patent protection
- Requires changes to be documented
- More explicit about trademark use

## Recommendation

### If "Check Only" Is the Goal:
1. **Remove or Replace the MIT License** with a custom restrictive license
2. Add a clear LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file with:
   ```
   Proprietary License - Source Available for Review

   Copyright (c) 2025 [Repository Owner]

   This software and associated documentation files (the "Software") are 
   made available for review and reference purposes only.

   Permission is NOT granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, 
   distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software without 
   explicit written permission from the copyright holder.

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
   ```

3. Add a prominent notice in README.md:
   ```markdown
   ## License Notice

   This repository is source-available for review purposes only. 
   Commercial use, copying, and distribution are prohibited without 
   explicit written permission from the repository owner.
   ```

### If Open Source Is the Goal:
Keep the current MIT License, which allows anyone to use, copy, and modify the code freely.

## Action Required

**Decision Point**: The repository owner needs to decide:

1. **Option A**: Keep MIT License (allows free use and copying by anyone)
2. **Option B**: Switch to a restrictive license (prevents copying and commercial use)
3. **Option C**: Use a hybrid approach (e.g., dual licensing)

**Note**: Once code is released under MIT License, you cannot retroactively revoke that license for versions already distributed. However, you can change the license for future versions.

## How to Change the License

If the repository owner decides to change the license:

1. Replace the LICENSE file content
2. Update the README.md to reflect the new license
3. Add license headers to source files (optional but recommended)
4. Create a new release/version with the new license
5. Notify any contributors (if applicable)

## Legal Disclaimer

This document provides general information only and does not constitute legal advice. For specific legal guidance on licensing, please consult with a qualified intellectual property attorney.

---

**Summary**: The current MIT License allows anyone to copy and use this solution freely. If the intent is "check only", the license needs to be changed to a more restrictive one.
